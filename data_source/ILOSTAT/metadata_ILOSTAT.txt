Notes:
Some records have different values per sources

To find the variables files, you can look at
download/www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/WEB_bulk_download/dic/indicator_*.csv
Prepend a frequency code to the variable name (A, Q, M).
Then the data is, for example for variable EAR_4MNP_NOC_NB annually, in 
indicator/EAR_4MNP_NOC_NB_A.csv.gz
The meaning of the column values with header some_header (classif1, 
note_indicator...) are in files
dic/some_header_en.csv

Replaces Laborsta which is in ../LABORSTA_ILO.

Important difference with GGDC:

Argentina, ARG, agricultural employment only from cities.  
"S4:32","Geographical coverage: Main city or metropolitan area",70
In EMP_TEMP_SEX_ECO_NB_A, and it is reused in reconstruction
EMP_2EMP_SEX_ECO_NB_A.  Other countries which also report 
agricultural employment in cities, the reconstruction 
are based on other data.

The following note_source correspond to cities: S4:31, S4:32, S4:33

Bolivia, BOL, source BA:74 has a coverage of S4:33 Main cities or 
metropolitan areas, until 1999.

Botswana, BWA, lower value in ILOSTAT than in GGDC.  No clear reason.

Colombia, COL. BA:358 has a coverage of S4:33 Main cities or 
metropolitan areas, until 2000 

Mexico, MEX, source AA:1399, which is used in 1990 is half of 
the remaining.  GGDC is similar to other dates, though lower.

Breaking points in 1990, though no change in magnitude, showing
a difference between GGDC and ILO, but nothing important:
Costa Rica?, Egypt?, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Malawi

Some data on earnings are too big and clearly incorrect. For
indicators like *_EAR_*
BRA source BA:356
BLR except for 2016
GHA 2006
VEN 2005,2006,2007
