# Inconsistencies :
# Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands are present in GTAP under country Norway, not considered in IEA. Special case ignored, since we don't have World Blank GDP data on these islands.  
# Lichtenstein is present in GTAP under XEF, not considered in IEA. Lichtenstein oil data is included in Euro area. Treated as a special case. 
# The kingdom of Eswatini (cited by IEA) changed names in 2018. GTAP and country-codes.csv still report it as Swaziland, and so do we.
# Puerto Rico is included in US for oil and coal statistics, but inputs and outputs from electricity and heat generation and natural gas data are included under Other OECD Americas. Special case ignored for now, long to implement. 
# IEA's 2020 documentation says Greenland and Malawi are not present in statistics (since 1990 for Greenland), but it is in our .ivt. 
# We account Greenland as in our .ivt data, but discard Malawi's data. For Malawi, the way to implement it would be to substract the DataFrame from OTHER_AFRICA before applying the algorithm for repartition, and delete it in this file.
