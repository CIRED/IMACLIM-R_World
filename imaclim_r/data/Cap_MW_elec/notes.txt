Installed electricity production capacities
Sources : IRENA for ENR; Global Power plant for Fossil fuels tech.; IAEA for nuke

Data by technology family (coal, gas, nuke, solar etc.) is extracted for the different years the same way as 2014 data: either manually or using R scripts.
In order to get a 12x26 csv (i.e. to get the IMC technological disaggregation) the script calibration.nexus.electricity.sce is run with the previously extracted dataframe.
This way, we make sure that the assumptions for technological disaggregation are consistent with calibration year's (for instance, subcritical coal accounting for 60% of total coal capacity).
