*************************** Irregularites on the above data and how they are treated:

* all_capital

- For the countries SVN and JPN, data are available up till 2006 included, and NA for 2007. 
  This is easily verifiable in the xls files located in 
  /data/shared/klems/raw/euklems/www.euklems.net/data/09I and ../09i

  For these 2 countries (JPN SVN), "NA" values have been added for 2007 by the process
  processDataEurope.py called by processData-europe.sh called by main.sh

- For JPN, data are provided with extra, more detailed industry-levels then for the other 
  countries in all_capital_09I.txt

  However, while more detailed industry-levels are present in the file, no actual data 
  are given. 

  For this reason, these industry-levels are deleted by processData-europe.sh called by main.sh
