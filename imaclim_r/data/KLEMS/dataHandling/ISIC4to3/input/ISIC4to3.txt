The 2012 release of the KLEMS Data uses NACE 2 industry classification based on ISIC 4. 
The previous releases are provided in NACE 1 classification based on ISIC 3.1.
In NACE 2 the economy is covered by 35 industries, in NACE 1 by 32 industries.
 
As specified in the methodology notes per country provided on the klems project website, many of the
industries are a near perfect match between both classifications, but some others not. 
The national accounts provide data in NACE 2 for shorter, more recent time series. 
Back casts have been done using industry matching tables available in the methodology notes per country.

The methodology notes for the data for France are here:

File ISIC4to3.csv is the matching table used to adapt the France klems data in ISIC 4 to ISIC 3, 
where one or many ISIC 4 industry-levels are matched to 1 ISIC 3 level.

The produced data is unsatisfactory for the following ISIC 3 levels :
- 20, which is matched to ISIC 4 16-18. 20 = wood and cork. 16-18 = wood products + printing
- 21t22 = pulp, paper, printing and publishing
