TODO: create variable names for file input. The input files are commented in NotesInput.txt


1. createIndex.py

Creates index from the rawdata. Only suited if the rawdata conform to a particular (typical KLEMS) format (see NotesInput.txt)

- takes initial values for variables -> to amend
- repetitive -> mk function
- loop too long
- insert comment : creates index based on what information ? 


2. importKLEMSData.py

Imports the rawdata and creates the same data organized in narrow format, with 1 value per line. 
The amount of lines equals the amount of possible combinations of the categorical variables (year included).

-> put input and output filenames as variables in the beginning
-> rename AllDataRearranged in AllDataNarrow


3. determineShares.py

For some IMACLIM industrial sectors the KLEMS Data do not provide sufficiently detailed information, i.e. provide aggregated information. 
Disaggregation, of the KLEMS Data for the KLEMS industrial sector levels concerned, is done on the basis of GTAP Capital stock data. 
Takes as input Capital.csv (from GTAP) and Capshares.csv: 
The first is used to specify the shares calibrating the disaggregation. The latter specifies the sectors. 


4. aggNarrowFormat_Countries.py

Linearly combines the KLEMS data to a 12-sector IMACLIM IO-format. 
The output is per country as specified by the KLEMS Data. Outputs the data in narrow format. 
Takes as input the shares per region as determined by determineShares.py (RegionsCapShares.csv) and 


- the information used of CapShares is also available in RegionsCapShares.csv -> supplant
- non-consistent naming between KLEMStoIMACLIM_products and KLEMStoIMACLIMindustries (underscore) -> amend


5. writeOut.py

Imports the data aggregated to (IMACLIM industries)^2 in narrow format to IO Tables per variable, country, year.
