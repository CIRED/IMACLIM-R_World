\section{Proposal for content of paper and its motivation}

Since there is close to no literature on the structure of fixed capital or formation of, per industry or over the whole economy, it seems a good idea to write a paper talking in a global sense of the temporal evolution of the structure of capital,  which is what you inititally proposed. More focused papers on a specific topic or industry can then refer to this one. The agreement is that this global analysis will be done on all countries in the sample.

In my opinion, in this global paper it has to be argued why this information is useful and what it can be used for, with suggestions for applications and 2 summarily worked out examples of applications.

[Not all types of data are interesting or useful, and if this data is, the data have to be characterized because they are not well known and their usefullness has to be shown in short examples.]

%Also, try out the idea that if there are structural evolutions in investment, these evolutions indicate qualitative changes occuring in a sector, because of innovation diffusing through investment. Based on this idea, a personal proposal to talk/think about the data and structural evolutions is to think in terms of "renewel of society" (renouvellement). Once a society has reached a minimum level of living-standard, the most interesting aspect of growth is not "more of the same" but "new things". New things, innovations, can be products/services/technologies, processes (assembly lines), lifestyles (driving a car every day) etc. This is a very general idea but at least for me it helps me how to think about the data and what to look for. I think it might also help with how to shape the results.

 %that have a qualitative effect on society.
%The diffusion of directed innovation (both technological and social) in society changes the structure of GFCF of specific sectors. Inversily, observing structural changes in capital investment on a sectoral level serves as an indicator of qualitative changes taking place in society.

%Based on this point of view, one can look back -- at our data at hand --, and look forward :
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Identify past periods of change in structure of sectoral investment (see Rubens list below) and put into relation with the qualitative change in economy/society. I think more then one example is needed since 2 seems a minimum if you want to make a more general statement. Obvious candidates is anything ICT related, look for another nonICT example.
%\item Mitigation scenarios draw both on technological as well as social innovation and probably often implicate changes in the structure of investment. (An idea might be : Construction : a strategy of the sector is to innovate in materials that are more durable and in the case of residential and non-residential structures to supply materials that isolate better, as a way to reduce costs for their clients. A lower depreciation rate for built structures, and lower energy use for heating and cooling in (non-)residential structures will change the structure of investment for the impacted sectors.) It seems to me that 2° mitigation scenarios ask for faster "renewal of society" then we had in the past, although this again is a general statement. 
%\end{enumerate}

%So my initial idea for structuring the paper was to motivate why structure of investment is important with point 2., illustrated with 1 short example, and when presenting the global data analysis, also identify 2 examples of point 1. This is probably too much, so the forward looking part goes.

%All of this might become more concrete if the results of the data analysis are there.

Ruben : ideas for sector-product specific analysis/questions
\begin{itemize}
\item Agriculture
	\begin{itemize}
    \item  assumption of constance for all materials goods (75\% in USA)? same for other countries? can we see catching up for some countries?
    \item traeq vs. other dynamics? what does it mean?
    \end{itemize}
\item Industry
	\begin{itemize}
    \item ICT in fig 4 is nominal or real? Can we identify a saturation? Same in other countries? Catching up?
    \item can we identify trends? do they hold for other OECD countries? can we see catchup in non oecd countries?
    		\begin{itemize}
        \item infrastructures / Traeq: decreasing
        \item Omach: constant
        \end{itemize}
     \end{itemize}
\item Services
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Need for RStruc/Ocon
    \item ICT story?
    \item Traeq story?
    \item Can we say that ICT increase translates into energy / emissions intensity reduction?
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

%O. Temporal investment data on sector x assets --- specifically considering structure, thus look at shares --- indicates innovation diffusing in society. Mitigation scenarios draw both on technological as well as social innovation.

%1. Under specific mitigation scenarios the structure of investment changes ; detail 2 examples...

%1.1 A mitigation scenario for personal vehicles that includes both electrification of the fleet and more sharing of vehicles %(=move towards service economy)
%, will change the structure of GFCF in several sectors. More sharing of vehicles should mean less investment in personal vehicles (part of transport equipment) as compared to a scenario with no sharing (in terms of amount of vehicles, the quality of vehicles might go up). Sharing is permitted by ICT capital. Electrification of the fleet demands investment in specific infrastructure and communication technology. (Note, household vehicles are not included in the klems data, but one might think that the professional personal vehicle park might also adopt the sharing paradigm.) Thus, the share of investment in transport equipment will be lower under a sharing scenario versus non-sharing, and electrification will increase in some kind of infrastructure (under what category does the kind of infrastructure in question fall, and which is the investing sector ?)

%1.2 Construction : a strategy of the sector is to innovate in materials that are more durable and in the case of residential and non-residential structures to supply materials that isolate better, as a way to reduce costs for their clients. A lower depreciation rate for built structures, and lower energy use for heating and cooling in (non-)residential structures will change the structure of investment for the impacted sectors.

%Hence, the diffusion of directed innovation (both technological and social) in society changes the structure of GFCF of specific sectors. Inversily, observing structural changes in capital investment on a sectoral level serves as an indicator of qualitative changes taking place in society.% as innovation spreads throughout the economy.

%2. Identify past periods of change in structure of sectoral investment and put into relation with the qualitative change in economy/society. Obvious candidates is anything ICT related, look for another nonICT example.

%2bis. Argue why data on investment per asset but not disaggregated per sector does not give and adequate picture.

%3. Use the knowledge on sector x asset evolution for something specific.  Sketch a more detailed picture of sectors evolution. % - investment provides link between bottom up technological data and macro data.
%Sectors capital structure evolution is an indicator of evolution of emissions, employment, type of job demand,...

%4. Two detailed examples of point 3., emissions BTP etc. 

What we talk about and not talk about: 
- We do not here talk about why the investment pattern is what it is, or how it came about ; i.e. we don not talk about the determinants of investment. Ample body of literature on this topic...(colins)
- We don not talk about the effect of investment/FC composition on growth/productivity.
- We talk about, given the investment pattern as is, what does it tell us of the way different sectors in different countries function, the choices they made (ex. high investment in public transport in Japan), changes in the functioning of sectors.) 

\section{The data}


\section{Methodology}\label{Method}
\subsection{Multifactor analysis}
%\todo{Same graph for K. Is USA still on the lower end for K? Is GFCF/VA low in the USA because of high K already, low labour costs, accounting differences, less redistribution (residential structures, travel equipment) ? }
The variables in the KLEMS capital input database, amongst which nominal investment ($I$), %and real investment ($Iq$), 
are detailed according to 4 categorical variables: country, year, product, industry. We first consider the nominal investment data of one country, the USA.

We focus on the analysis of the temporal evolution of industries' structure of investment, by which the following is meant: writing as $I_{ipy}$ industry $i$'s nominal investment level in product $p$ during year $y$ for the country under consideration, we consider the shares of its total investment-level $I_{i.y}\equiv \sum_p I_{ipy}$ each industry allocates to each asset in year $y$: 
$$
\frac{I_{ipy}}{I_{i.y}},
$$ 
and analyse whether and how these shares evolve over time.
\subsubsection{Theory}
The method of analysis is multifactor analysis for contingency tables (MFACT), designed for the simultaneous analysis of several contingency tables, sharing at least one variable (ie rows or columns). In our case, this amounts to considering a product x industry table for every year. All tables share both variables. The methodology is introduced in \citep{becue2004principal} and its application using R with the FactoMineR package is presented in \citep{kostov2013multiple}. 

The method is implemented by first constructing a large table that consists of row-wise concatenating the product x industry contingency tables for every year. To give an equal weight to every subtable, each one is weighted with the inverse of their first eigenvalue.\footnote{For example, if all the values in a table are doubled, the first eigenvalue doubles. The weighting thus corrects for a general volume and/or inflation effect if level data were to be analyzed.} The method then consists of both performing a principle component analysis (PCA) on the large table, and PCA's on each subtable. 

PCA, when performed on a table with industries in the rows and products in the columns, starts with interpreting the table as a representation of every industry in a space constructed with the product-types as axes. The coordinates of industries $i$ in this space are the shares $\frac{I_{ipy}}{I_{i.y}}$. The procedure will then construct new axis, called dimensions, linear combinations of the original product types, that consecutively are the directions in which there is the most variance in the data cloud. Often PCA is used to identify redundancy in a group of variables, and to retain those variables that contain the most information, ie that capture the most variance. This is not our type of problem. [Needs to be completed.]


Since, in our case, the analysis is performed on investment shares $\frac{I_{ipy}}{I_{i.y}}$ and not on the level data $I_{ipy}$, the tables already each approximately have the same weight. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
   \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/method/MCT.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:MCT}The multiway contingency table formed by the row-wise juxtaposition of each year's contingency table. In our case, we put (for example) industries in the rows and products in the columns. 38 tables are juxtaposed, from 1970 to 2007. (Source:  \citep{kostov2013multiple}).}
\end{figure} 

Say we construct a large mulitway table as in figure \ref{fig:MCT}, with industries in rows and products in columns, consisting of the 38 tables for each year from 1970 to 2007. The generated output consists of the results of each of the individual pca's and of the global pca. We use the latter, and focus for now on the following parts of the output :

\begin{itemize}
\item coordinates with respect to the new dimensions :
\begin{itemize}
\item for every product for every year on each of the new dimensions,
\item for every industry for every year on each of the new dimensions,
\item average (over years) coordinates for each product,
\item average (over years) coordinates for each industry,
\item group-coordinates, ie coordinates for every year, ie every table, on the new dimensions, 
\end{itemize}
\item contributions to the dimensions by each of the three variables :
\begin{itemize}
\item for each product, the sum of the per year contributions, which indicates the total contribution of the product to the dimension,
\item for each industry, the sum of the per year contributions, which indicates the total contribution of the industry to the dimension,
\item for each year, contributions to the dimensions.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The coordinates of the variables (product, year, industry) are visualized on 2-dimensional graphs formed per pair of consecutive dimensions. These dimensions are linear combinations of the meaningful, original categories the variables take. For example, for the products, the original categories are the 8 product-types. When coordinates of an industry for every year are plotted on a dimA - dim(A+1) plane, a time trajectory is visualized for that industry. Combined with the interpretation of the dimensions in terms of the products, one can then deduce an interpretation of the type of, "the industry in question has moved towards a pattern of investing less in product-type(s) yy and more in product type(s) xx over the period considered".
%To interpret the graphs, the dimensions have to be expressed in terms of the

Both for industries and products time trajectories can be considered. Their shapes in a dimA - dim(A+1) plane are related and it is helpful to visualize them on the same graph to easily see the associations. Plotting on the same graph is not straightforward because the coordinates of both variables (products and industries) are not of the same order of magnitude so all the product trajectories are huddled in the center and all the industries' trajectories are properly visible on the graph, or vice versa, depending on the level of aggregation considered for each one.

If the objective is producing plots that serve as an easy way to visually apprehend the data, on a qualitative level, then the best way to handle this is to multiply the coordinates with a scale factor.

(Some time ago, I implemented the following approach : I thought the source of this difference in scale was the asymmetrical treatment of rows and columns, and thus performed two MFACT on the data, one with the industries in the rows and one with the products in the rows, to then generate graphs based on both outputs. This worked, as it turns out by accident, because it doesn't work when the level of disaggregation of industries is very different from the one of the products ; for example when considering the 32 industries which is the most detailed disaggregation possible versus the 8 product types.)

So in the end, I think the best option is to scale the coordinates so that visual apprehension is facilitated, which is a straightforward solution.

\subsubsection{MFA implementation in R}
The function created in R to perform the MFACT and produce the graphs is the following :

outputMFACT(inputdata, countryHere, varHere, yearVector, industryVector, productVector, share=FALSE, quality, colour\_industries, colour\_products)

\begin{itemize}
\item inputdata : takes the form of a table with 4 categorical variables, country, var(iable) (nominal investment, capital stock,...), product, industry and 2 numerical variables : year (an integer) and value. The names of the variables have to be exact. Country, var, product and industry have to be factors.
\item varHere : the variable the analysis is to be performed on,
\item yearVector : a selection of years,
\item industryVector, a selection of industries,
\item productVector, a selection of product-types,
\item share : when TRUE the analysis will be performed on the shares, when FALSE the analysis will be performed on the data as is, the default is FALSE,
\item quality : this is an option that concerns the output graphs and allows to only project on a dimA - dim(A+1) plane in the new factor space the points that are closer then a certain distance to that plane. The logic is that only points close to the plane are well represented by a projection on the plane. If they are far away from the plane, they are better represented on another plane. The implementation of this feature is non-perfect and maybe not very useful since it is generally the points close to the origin of the plane that are badly represented so the information is already present on the graph.
\item coulour\_industries : needs to be at least as long as the number of industries in industryVector.
\item coulour\_products : needs to be at least as long as the number of products in productVector.
\end{itemize}


\section{Literature}
Topics covered in the literature related to fixed capital formation and capital structure/heterogeneity:
\begin{itemize}
\item determinants of growth, growth accounting:
\item development accounting:
\item prices of capital goods as a determinant of investment: \citep{collins2001capital}
\item ICT:
\item equipment and growth \citep{collins2001capital}
\item stagnation
\item disagregation of capital in different vintages - investment diffuses innovation in society:
\end{itemize}



In \citep{kennedy2013past} capital investment data, for OECD countries over the period 1997-2007, in Residential structures (dwellings), Transport equipment and Other machinery and equipment is used in conjunction with emissions data from respectively energy use (fuel combustion only) from the residential and transport sectors, and from energy use and industrial processes from Energy and Industry sectors, to identify periods of green growth. These are defined as periods where investment grows, but associated emissions decline.

They identify a period of green growth in the residential sector in Sweden. Investment grows by 138\% and GHG emissions (electricity use not included) declines by 72\% over the 11 year period. The expenses and investments that allowed the decline in emissions are not the investments made in the residential sector. The data are to be interpreted as a possibility of lowering emissions despite growth in a sector. Hence, when the article notes that "the rate of reduction of emissions rose as the rate of capital formation increased" and that after 2007, the decline in residential investments is accompanied by the stagnation of emissions from the sector after 2007, both are probably due to the overall environment for investment - profitable before 2008 and less so after.

Regarding which sectors invest in these three classes of assets, from the klems data, we learn that (data are for USA 2007) :
\begin{itemize}
\item investment in Residential structures comes from only one sector. 
\item Investment in Transport equipment comes from all sectors, but mainly from sectors doing renting of machinery and equipment (71t74) and the Financial, Retail and Transport sectors. Investment in Transport equipment does not include household vehicles. 
\item Investment in Other machinery and equipment comes mainly from the Manufacturing sector (25\%), from Community (23\%) (Public adiminstration, Defense, Education, Health), with the Health sector being the main contributor to OMach investment in the commnity sector (60\%) and the Retail sector (15\%). Elec, Gas and Water, "Rental", Mining and Agriculture all account for  around 6\% GFCF in OMach. 
\end{itemize} 
 
%\subsection{agriculture}

\citep{zidkova2011analysis} presents investment in the czech agricultural sector over the period 1998-2009 and decomposes investment in agricultural assets (animals and plantings) and non-agricultural assets (machinery and equipment, buildings, other). The volatility of the nominal investment levels in all  three non-agricultural assets is mentioned, as is an increase in the share of investment in machinery and equipment, showing an accelaretion in the mechanization of the Czech agricultural sector. As factors influencing  the structure of investment are mentioned : the structure of the stock during the previous period, technological progress and the changing relative prices of the different types of assets (a change in the subsidy policy in 2007 is noted). The authors conclude that the influence of these factors is hard to assess on the macro level because of the quality of the data.

%Because of the important effects of the construction industry on a national economy, both in terms of the provision of infrastructure and creation of jobs, and because of the last reason the use by the government of increasing infrastrcutre spending during a period of high unemployment, \citep{wibowo2009contribution} proposes a model of the interaction of the industry with the national economy in developing countries, specifically modelling a labour intensive construction sector.


\citep{stewart2013restoring} stresses that the importance of investment lies not in acquiring more of the same but in diffusing innovation. New capital is virtually always different from existing capital. Secondly, they argue that there is not only a spillover effect from innovation but also from adopting innovation, ie from investing. Because the benefit of investing for society surpasses the benefit accruing strictly to the firm, GFCF is too low. They give six reasons for the GFCF spillover effect, amongst which, lowering costs and spurring innovation because of higher demand, lower emissions because new equipment is often more energy efficient and network effects associated with ICT. Three types of capital assets are ranked according to the degree of the spillover effect: structures and ICT are seen as offering respectively low and high benefit to firms and the economy, with machinery and equipment in between. The paper has been written by The information technology \& innovation foundation, USA. Time series of investment in these three types of assets, also per sector, are discussed for the US. The analysis is of growth rates.

\begin{itemize}
\item Structures : A time series of private investment in manufacturing structures is presented for 1925-2011, showing a decline from 1980 on, "key symptom of a decline in the international competitiveness of the U.S. manufacturing sector".
\item Equipment and Software : business investment in this category increased at an average rate of 2,5\% over the period 1980–1991, of 8.8\% over the period 1992–2000, and of 0.5\% during 2001–2011. Excluding ICT\footnote{Time series for ICT are constructed using a general price index, not an ICT specific one (as done by BEA) with quality corrections.}, they find that machinery and equipment declined at a rate of 8\% over the last period. Next they present the growth rates of investment in equipment and software per industry. They note that even during the period 1992-2000 of high growth of GFCF, many sectors contribute to investment in Eq and software but is still unevenly spread over the economy with construction putting a "drag on total equipment and software growth". Interaction between sectors and technological specificty is not considered. Also, the manufacturing industry is taken over by Finance as the big investor in Eq \& Soft during the years 2000. They reject the idea that the decline in the manufacturing sector is due to delocalization because even the chemical industry, considered competitive, shows declining investment during the 2000s. Several explanations might be hypothesized that they do not consider. One could be declining returns to adopting new better ICT equipment. The authors do not consider quality adjustments for the ICT category, and make a logical mistake when attaching a conclusion, on the urgency of the situation to invest more in ICT, to the stagnant time series, because of its high depreciation rate, although they constructed the time series as if ICT depreciates at the same rate as other assets. [To further test their findings and conclusions would have to compare with klems data.]
%so the finding that a lower share of VA is invested in ICT might mean that the industry adopting the technology is starting to profit more from the price effect of technological progress in the type of asset than from the quality change. Since ICT is a considerable share of the category they consider, the effect of declining investment might be that once the new technology is introduced, during the 2000s it became less necessary to maintain high rates of investment in new, better ICT equipment (could be evaluated with klems data?). One reason for this might lie in the declining usefullness of the innovations in ICT and thus less fast adoptation by the industry. 
\end{itemize}

Capital composition of 119 countries is compared in \citep{mutreja2014equipment}, using capital stock measures constructed by the author with investment data for 119 countries from 1950–2004 in structures (residential and non-residential), and equipment (transport and other equipment)\footnote{Data from the Center for International Comparisons and PWT 6.3. Depreciation rates structures and equipment $\delta_s= 0.02$ $\delta_e= 0.14$}. The decomposition of capital is used to develop the stylized fact that rich countries have higher capital intensity than pour countries. For rich countries, equipment capital represents 21\% on average of total capital stock, and for poor countries 8\%. For several measures $S$, the ratio of the measure between the 10\% richest and the 10\% poorest countries are given ($S_{rich}/S_{poor}$): for the capital-output ratio for structures it is 3 ($=(K_{str}/Y)_{rich}/(K_{str}/Y)_{poor}$), and for equipment it is 7, the ratio for equipment-capital per worker = 156 and for structures 66, GDP is 780,  capital structures is 2300 and equipment capital is 5500. Thus the dispersion amongst countries in equipment-capital is larger than the dispersion in income per capita. Also, $Y/L$ is correlated with $K_{eq}/Y$ but not with $K_{str}/Y$. (Next growth accounting is done.) 
They also find that the dispersion in equipment capital has increased over time while the dispersion in structures has decreased. Structures includes both residential structures, infrastructure and manufacturing structures.
(Can these data be split up in residential and non-residential structures? One would think that countries built up residential structures first and that non-residential structures would be correlated with investment in equipment.)

\citep{mutreja2016composition}

\citep{chaudhuri2002economic}


\citep{mccarthy2004investment} (Fed) investigates whether the reduction in investment (negative growth rates) in the US in the beginning of the 2000's occurs in the assets in which there was high growth in investment during the 90's. IT Soft, OMach TraEq and Other. "In the boom years of the late 1990s, the share of investment growth attributable to IT was about two-thirds." In 2000 and 2002, expenditures on other equipment fell and in IT grew (even more than in 90s). In the 90's, IT and Soft contributed most to growth, during 1998-2002 a shift occures within ICT ; in 2000 CT is the biggest contributor to growth -> "deregulation, the proliferation of wireless communications, and the Internet boom and associated investments in broadband Internet connections." In 2001 already reversed. Discussion per industry : The high growth in investment in CT by the communications industries is deemed as overly optmistic because to justify it (according to their estimates) unrealistically high profit increases would have been needed that did not occur. Nevertheless, this does not mean necessarily imply that the industry was overly optmisitic about returns. When an innovation presents itself to an industry, its different actors must move fast no to be outplayed by their rivals and loose their share of the market. The surplus capital stock created by the very high investment rate serves a purpose of occupying the market. One might conclude that when the diffusion of an innovation is regulated by the market, investment occurs too fast. There are advantages and disadvanteges : high demand stimulates further innovation (as pointed out by \citep{stewart2013restoring}), creates a net loss because of surplus capital stock, and might also result in changes affecting society too fast for it to adapt --- distruction of some kinds of jobs and creation of others.

\citep{greenwood1997long} decomposes capital into capital whose price evolves as the general consumption price index (structures) and capital that has a fast decreasing price index. The latter type of capital is equipment, including thus IT. The decreasing price index represents investment specific technological change. It's role as an engine of growth is estimated with a GE model. Equipment accumulates according to $\dot{k}_e = (1-\delta_e)k_e + q\,i_e$ where q represents the state of technology for producing equipment and $y = c + i_e + i_s$. (It is a little weird to put the q in the accumulation equation. $K_e$ and $i_e$ should be counted in the same unit, namely the number of pieces of equipment. It should be $y = c + q\,i_e + i_s$ and the usual accumulation equation for $k_e$. But in practice this maybe makes no difference probably?)% The price index of equipment is included in the model to derive a conclusion on factor specific technological change and TFP. 

\citep{caselli2004importing} uses import and export data to disagregate equipment capital for a large sample of 155 countries into 9 types of capital goods: fabricated metal products, non-electrical equipment, office and computing equipment, electrical equipment, communications equipment, moto vehicles, other transport equipment, aurcraft, measuring and optical equipment. this approach is based on a the obesrvation that "most of the world’s capital is produced in a small number of R\&D-
intensive countries, while the rest of the world generally imports its equipment" \citep{eaton2001trade}.
- Development accounting : cross country variation in the composition of K.(Note for us, compare our variations per country and per industry for the same countries with theirs.)
- Explanation cross-country differences shares different tyes of capital equipment ? Country caracteristics taken into account : Human capital, inward and outward foreign direct investment, degree of protection of property rights, share of government in GDP, financial development, sectoral composition of GDP, "remoteness" (distance to the rest of the world), 
- Can these differences explain diff in labour productivity ? "Different types of capital are intrinsically more or less efficient" Duh. complemenarity capital and country caracteristics.

R\&D : 15 countries account for 90\% of expenses.


\citep{collins2001capital} 1870-1950 for 11 OECD countries. Goals of the paper: - construct time series of prices and identify their determinants (evolution over time and cross-country differences). Price effect on investment rates. 
Pre-WOI, equipment prices decline (productivity advance in the equipment-producing sector [compare ICT today]) and construction prices rise. " For each country a relative price index is formed by dividing the capital-goodsprice index by the consumption-goods price index"
One of the findings : "the US growth rate outpaced the predictions of long-run convergence regressions." One of the explaining factors is th relative low relative (to general proces) capital goods prices.

\citep{blundell2015infrastructure} Possible reasons for stagnation : - fall in natural real interest rate, lack of demand, past over-investment, debt-financed over-invesment with too low return,

\caption{Desagregation of total industry for which the investment data are available. Sector codes correspond to the ISIC 3.1 standard.}
\label{IndKLEMS}
\end{table}

The GFCF data are available at a disagregation-level of total industry into 32 sectors (cf. table \ref{IndKLEMS}). To simplify analysis %of the temporal evolution of the investment structure of the sectors
, we will first determine whether the following subdivisions have a similar structure based on a visual examination of investment data of the USA (figures \ref{struct-Manu} and \ref{struct-GHIJK}):
\begin{itemize}
\item the 14 sectors that make up the manufacturing sector (D), 
\item the 3 sectors (50, 51 and 52) that make up Wholesale and Retail Trade (G) and Hotels (H),
\item Transport and Storage (60t63) and Post and Telecommunications (64), the two components of I,
\item Financial Intermediation (J), Real Estate Activities (70) and Renting of M\&Eq and Other Business Activities (71t74). (With 70 + 71t74=K, Real Estate and Business Services.) 
\end{itemize}
The temporal evolution of the structure of "traditional" capital assets and of "ICT" assets are analyzed independently. The traditional capital assets are Residential structures (RStruc), Other construction (OCon = Non-residential structures + Infrastructure), Other Machinery (OMach), Travel equipment (TraEq) and Other, and the ICT assets are Information technology (IT), Communication technology (CT) and Software (Soft).

\begin{itemize}
\item Based on figure \ref{struct-Manu}, the manufacturing sector will be taken into account in the analysis at its most aggregated  level, D ; each of the 13 sectors are similar in investment structure and its evolution.
\item Sectors 50, 51, 52 and H are also similare enough to be considered together. Only sector 51, Wholesale trade, shows a slightly different structure in that it invests less in Other construction, but will wwill in first instance be lumped together with Retail trade.  
\item Transport and storage 60t63 and Telecom 64 display a rather different investment structure, and are considered seperatily.
\item Residential 70 stands on its own. Financial intermediation J and 71t74 show for the USA a relatively similar structure but are functionally different and are considered seperately. 
\end{itemize}
Total industry is thus disagregated in 12 levels, listed in table \ref{sectorweights}. The choice for this level of detail is a starting point and does not exclude an analysis at a more detailed level, notably for the manufacturing sector, further on.

The analysis was done on a disagregation of industries in 12 sectors and the 8 available product-types. Figures \ref{MFACT12x8_dim14}, \ref{MFACT12x8_dim47} and \ref{MFACT12x8_dim710} represent time trajectories of the products and industries with their coordinates in the new factor space, for dimensions 1-10. Section \ref{dims} interprets the new dimensions in terms of the projections of the original variables - products, industries and years. 

[How to use MFA ? We are interested in temporal evolutions. MFA constructs new dimensions, %according to the specificities of the sectors ; i.e. different sectors have different investment profiles. The dimensions are constructed according to these profiles, 
according to the variability coming from the fact that different industries invest in different assets. Then, industries' investment profiles evolve ; these evolutions are represented with respect to the dimensions constructed on the basis of the specificities of the sectors. Why is this the apropriate way to represent the temporal evolution of investment profiles?]

\subsubsection{Interpretation of the dimensions}
[To be completed, this is schematic.]

\textbf{Products}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dim1} : the first dimension opposes investment in residential structures to investment in all other products, mainly Other machinery.
\item \textbf{Dim2} : the second dimension opposes investment in Communication technologies to investment in Other machinery.
\item \textbf{Dim3} : the third dimension opposes investment in Other construction to investment in Travel equipment and ICT.
\item \textbf{Dim4} : the fourth dimension opposes investment in Other machinery to investment in IT and Soft.
\item \textbf{Dim5} : the fifth dimension opposes investment in transport equipment (1970) to investment in ICT (1970)
\item \textbf{Dim6} : the sixth dimension captures a specific evolution in Other coming grom Sales and Agri.
\item \textbf{Dim7} : the seventh dimension captures an evolution in IT and software, coming from the financial sector.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{General observations}
\begin{itemize}
\item The trajectories of Soft and IT are associated. The trajectory of CT is much less associated with IT and Soft; investment in CT started much earlier. (CT also doesn't depreciate as fast.)
\item CT "resembles" more OMach than Soft and IT.
\item Investment in CT by the Transport sector as they invest less in TraEq ?
\end{itemize}

Would it be useful to :
\begin{itemize}
\item Do the analysis on (RStruc), OCon, TraEq, (Other), OMach and CT ? Check for their evolution without being influenced by Soft and IT ? Add them as extra vars.
%\item Do the analysis without Other, since we don't know what is in it, and something specific seems to be going on (dim6), hence it influences the analysis a lot but hard to interpret. So leave out ?
\end{itemize}

\end{table}
One way to approach the results of the MF analysis is by first choosing on which sectors or products to concentrate, and then looking at the dimensions that tell us most specifically something about those sectors or products. To identify the dimensions that tell us most specifically something about... [to be completed]
We start with looking at investment in OCon, OMach and TraEq which together make up a 50-80\% of investment. Table \ref{bestrep-prod} shows for each of these products the 4 dimensions to which they contribute the most. Together, they are best represented in dimensions 3, 5, 9, 10 and 4, with dimensions 9 and 10 occurring 3 times and 3 and 4 occuring 2 times. Thus, to learn something specific about these three assets, we can investigate the dim3-4 plane and the dim9-10 plane. To better figure out what happens in the dim9-10 plane with these assets, refer to figure \ref{MFACT12x8_dim910CDEF}. To understand what effect is represented in the higher dimensions, it is necessary to know what variability is already accounted for in the lower dimensions. 

\subsubsection{Dimensions 1-2}
The first dimension maps Residential sector to dwellings. 

The second dimensions captures that Telecomm is the big investor in CT, and also happens to be the smallest investor in OMach. It thus sets the Telecom sector apart from the group Agri, Construction and Manufacturing who are big investors in OMach and allocate amongst the least to CT.

\subsubsection{Dimensions 3-4}
The positive side of the dimensions 3 and 4 captures higher than average investment in IT and Soft, whose trajectories are associated (when they are not, would they be more associated if corrected with their specific price indices?). In the beginning of the period, Finance and Rental both allocate higher than average investment shares to IT and Soft. As investment in IT/Soft generally increases (over all sectors), the deviation from this pattern becomes smaller and hence the trajectory from 1970 to 2007 moves inward (towards the center of the graph.) %The higher than average investment in IT/Soft is in dimension 3 opposed to OCon and in dimension 4 to OMach. 

This specific behaviour of the Finance and Rental sectors towards IT/Soft investment (+ the fact that they allocate relatively equal shares (compared to the other sectors) on the other asset-types), captured by dimensions 3 and 4 is in each respectively oppopsed to a high investment share in respectively OCon (dim3) and OMach (dim4) %, to the fact that Finance and Rental spend more on IT/Soft than the other sectors, and relatively equal shares (more than the others) on the other asset-types 
(cf. figure \ref{MFACT12x8_dim14}, bottom graphs). The third dimension also oppposes a high share in OCon to a high share in TraEq, where high TraEq is associated with higher than average IT/Soft. (The more negative coordinate means higher investment in OCon and the more positive coordinate means higher investment in TraEq.) Denoting an evolution from higher to lower investment share OCon as moving along the axis from negative to positive values as $+$ OCon $-$ $\longrightarrow$, we can summarize for dim 3: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  $+$ OCon $-$ $\longrightarrow$ $-$ TraEq $+$. Along the way, there is also an associated evolution in ICT assets : \mbox{$\longrightarrow$ $+$ IT, Soft $-$} and $\longrightarrow$ $-$ CT $+$.
\end{itemize} 
Dimension 3 associates investment behaviour in IT and Soft in 1970 with investment behaviour in CT in 2007. Why ? 

The dim3-4 plane also situates CT with respect to IT/Soft on the one hand and OCon, OMach on the other.

Thus, Mining, Community and Elec Gas appear as the big investors in OCon and low in TraEq and in IT/Soft, over the whole period. Transport, Finance and Rental are lower than average in OCon, and higher than average in TraEq, and IT/Soft.

The big investors in OMach are Agri, Manufact and Construction. They all appear on the negative part of dimenstion 3, close to OMach ; they are "pulled up" by their investment pattern in IT/Soft.

The positions of Agri, Telecomm ...

%The method sets apart profiles that are furthest away from the average profile. It detects industries with a profile furthest away from the average profile, and it detects product profiles furthest away from the average profile. 

%We want to know something about temporal evolution. What is the interest for us of learning something about the average profile and the profiles that are the most different ? Are we interested in what the average profile is ? The industries, products, that are best represented by the higher dimenstions are the ones that exhibit a most average profile. Characterize this average profile ? We are interested in temporal evolution of investment profiles. Do sectors show change in what they invest in, and if there is change, what kind of conclusion to attach to that ? If sectors do show change,
%How does the method help to identify temporal evolution ? It identifies temporal evolution that is different from the average temporal evolution. Look at the graphs that exhibit a clear temporal trend. 

% there is something specific going on with Other in dimension 6, but we don't know what the content of other is. 

%Every dimension opposes effects in 2 variables, so that might indicate some association. 

%The first dimensions capture the most peculiar behaviour in the investment matrices, where peculiar means that some sector shows an investment profile that is most different from the average profile. "Most different" means that the sector invests in  (some) other product(s) than the other sectors. Inversely, the products that show the most different profile, are the ones that are invested in, in a different way than average by one or more sectors. This is seen in dimensions 1 and 2. The first ... and the second captures that the telecomm sector exhibits a constant investment pattern in CT. The temporal trajectory of CT along the second axis comes from the fact that in 2007 some of the other sectors also invest in CT. 

%The higher dimensions will pick up effects coming from products in which all sectors invest and pick up slightly different than average behaviour coming from those assets. 

%\subsubsection{CT}

%The second dimension captures that CT is mainly invested in by the TeleCom sector. The third dimension associates investment behaviour in 1970 IT and Soft (very low share) with investment in CT.	



%In second instance, the dimension associates high investment in TraEq with the investment behaviour in IT and Soft in 1970 for the Transport, Rental and Finance sectors, and CT 2007. Why ? Is it because Fincance and Rental invest more in IT and Soft in 1970 than the others ? But why is 2007 CT associated with 1970 Soft and IT ? The movement (back and forth) of Rental and Finance on the third dimension is dominated by their investment share in TraEq (higher in 1970 and 2007 than in between). As is the movement of the Transport sector, which allocates a decreasing share of investment to travel equipment over the years. Associated with the investment behaviour in TraEq is investment in IT and Soft and CT. Within this group of sectors, investment in CT is also relatively higher in 2007 and more increasing (Transport and Rental). Within this same group, investment in IT and Soft is relatively higher already in 1970.


%The trajectory of TraEq is U shaped because of the influence of the Finance and Rental sectors, which both allocate a higer share of investment in the beginning and at the end of the period than in between. 

%Thus, the first effect registered after the very specific effect captured in dimensions 1 and 2, is a division between industries that invest more than an average share in OCon and industries that invest more than an average share in TraEq. There is an associated effect in ICT investment: investing more in TraEq is associated with lower htan average investment in IT and Soft and higher than averga in CT.

%Dimenstion 3 captures an opposition in investment in OCon in 2000's with that fact of investing in TraEq. OCon follows a time trajectory along the 3rd dimension, TraEq hardly so, or maybe a back and forth movement. IT and Soft travel along the 3rd dimension with 1970 furthest away from OCon 2000's and IT-Soft-2007 closer to center. CT follows an opposite direction along the 3 dimension compared to IT-Soft.

%The sectors associated with OCon are Mining, Elec and Community. The points most to the left are highest in investment share in Other Construction. For the mining sector there is an evolution over this period, with highest OCon in 2007. For Elec gas and Community the trajectory along the third dimension is influenced both by OCon and TraEq and ICT.

%Construction seems badly represented on this axis. The dimensions opposes high investment in OCon and TraEq and for construction both go down over the period, pulling the trajectory in both directions.


\subsubsection{Dimensions 9-10}

\textbf{Dimension 9} associates investment in travel equipment, other machinery and Other construction - TraEq and Other machinery do opposite tajectory in time ? 

\textbf{Dimension 10} captures an evolution in between the early seventies and the 2000's, over which OCon and OMach follow opposite trajectorie with OMach more than average end 2000's and OCon more than average beginning 1970, and vice versa (less than average). The sectors contributing to this evolution are Community and Mining who both are abover average in 1970.

\section{MFACT on multiple countries}
Analysis of nominal investment data in local current currency for multiple countries is performed, for the period 1970 - 2007, to assess to what extent countries differ in investment behaviour. The method of choice is MFACT, as described in section \ref{Method}, on the sideways concatenation of the per year and per country sub-contingency-tables that describe for each of the industries (rows) in what assets they invest (columns). %The quantitative variable on which analysis is performed is nominal investment, in local current currency. 
The different per year and per country sub-contingency-tables become comparable, or get equal weight, because the method corrects for inflation and differences in currency by dividing every subtable by its first eigenvalue.

For 9 countries data are available for 1970-2007. For Japan data are available for 1970-2006, for Austria 1976 - 2007 and for 4 more countries data are available starting in the '90s. 

Analysis can either be performed by choosing a subset of countries for which data are available   over the same time range, or by including all countries. The first has the disadvantage that only a limited set of countries can be included or that the time range needs to be reduced. The latter has the disadvantage that the interpretation of the dimensions becomes more delicate, since some countries and some years will contribute, by construction, less to the new dimensions since they are represented by less sub-contingency-tables.

\li{Decision on 29/3: MFACT is analyzed for 10 countries, Australia, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, UK, USA, 1970-2006. Lets first see what information we can get out of this. Optional folow-up : 11 countries, of which 9 from 1970-2007, Japan 1970-2006 and Austria 1976-2007.}

\subsubsection{Pre-treatment of data}

\paragraph{Negative values} Multifactor analysis sometimes captures information that is not really of interest. In our case, negative values tend to do this. To keep an eye open for particularities put forward by the analysis that are created by a few negative values, they are listed in table \ref{neg-NA}.

It might be best to initially omit the asset-category Other, because this category groups very different types of both tangibles such as cultivated assets, fuel elements for nuclear reactors and musical instruments, and also intangibles, such as knowledge obtained through mineral exploration and artistic originals. Graphs \ref{fig:I_I-Iprod_bar12x_Other} and \ref{fig:I_I-VA_bar12x_Other} show the industries investing in Other for most countries are Community, the Agricultural and Mining sector. In the case of the Mining sector, Other represents knowledge on mineral exploitation. The five countries with a sizeable Mining sector (as a share of VA) are UK, Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands and the USA. For the first 4 countries, the Mining sector --- whose capital asset where mostmoney goes to is Other construction (wells etc.) --- invest in Other. For the USA, the Mining sector does not invest in Other, which seems to be an accounting issue and not a representation of a different reality of the ameriacna mining sector. In the case af the agricultural sector, Other corresponds to land being converted to cultivated land. In Australia in particular, a large effort hase been done in between ... to convert woodland to agricultural land (\ref{fig:I_I-VA_bar12x_Other}). Because of this, in Autralia investment in Other has been much larger as a share of VA () than in most countries, wher investment in Other as a share of VA does not exceed 0.5\%. In Japan and the Netherlands, investment in the category Other fluctuates around 2\% and 1.5\% of VA respectively. Many sectors invest in assets from this category. We do not have information to detail what these sectors invest in. 

[Does make sense to follow the evolution of this category for 1 country.]

[Because Computer equipment and Software are for the period considered new assets, characterized by fast declines in their prices and simultaneaously fast quality improvements, and rapid increase in investment in these assets (compare Mach and equipment pre-WOI), data analysis is done on both the group of 5 assets excluding them --- RStruc, OCOn, OMach, TraEq, CT --- and on the 7 assets.]

\paragraph{Data modifications}

\begin{itemize}
\item Italy is the only country for which investment in Residential structures (RStruc) is done by the sector Renting of M\& equipement (71t74). In all other countries, investment in RStruc is almost exclusively done by the Real estate sector (70), and RStruc is also almost the only sector the real estate sector invests in. Thus, the italian exception is seen as an accounting issue and the amount invested in RStruc by 71t74 is reallocated to 70. 
\item For Denmark, investment in Other reaches some proportianally large negative values (\ref{fig:I_I-Iprod_bar12x_Other}) which get a lot of attention in the analysis. To avoid that this fact gets to much importance in the overall analysis, the negative data entries in Other are transformed into NA's, that are then "filled in" by the R function imputeMDA which serves the purpose of treating missing data for multifactor analysis. The filled in data, replacing hte negative values, are "consensual".
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Interpretation MFACT 10 countries, 8 products, 12 industries, 37 years}
MFACT is run on a disaggregation of industry in 12 sectorial levels, all 8 product-levels are included, over 37 years, and 10 countries. To interpret the output, graphs are used to plot the coordinates of [explain better] in the new factor space and plot temporal trajectories of industries and products, for each country. The contributions to the dimensions are used to learn for each dimensions which industries, products, countries, years, are the biggest contributors to each dimension. Distances to the new axes (or to the planes), as measured by the $cos^2$ of the angle between points in the factor space and the projection axes, are used to not plot trajectories that are not well represented on a plane in question.

\caption{Multifactor analysis for contingency tables with 10 countries, 8 products, 12 industries, 37 years:  distances to the projection space of the industries (individuals). Column "Dim.1" gives the average (over countries and time) distance of industries to the Dim.1 axis. Column "Dim. 2" gives the distance to the dim1-2 plane ; column "Dim.3" gives the distance to the space dim1-2-3, etc. } 
\label{table:dist_10countries_I}
\end{table}

The datapoints that have "large" coordinates along a certain axis, but are far away from the axis or the projection plane, compared to the datapoints that have high contributions to the dimension in question, as seen from the coordinates in the subsequent dimensions, are badly represented on the dimension in question. These are omitted from the graphs.

%Are omitted, on the basis of the distances listed in table \ref{table:dist_10countries_I} and the contributions \ref{contrib-10Countries} :
%\begin{itemize}
%\item plane 1-2 : Mining (C) because it has a 10 simes smaller contribution dimension 1 than Realestate (70) but is 40 times closer to the axis. Regarding the plane dim1-2, the distance of Mining (C), Finance (J) and 64 is much larger than that of Real estate which is the big contributor to dim1. 
%\item plane 2-3: plot Mining since it is the big contributor to dimension 2. Maybe not plot J.
%\item plane 3-4: not plot C and with and without Post and Telecomm 64
%\item plane 4-5: \end{itemize}


On the graphs of the projections of the data points on the new dimensions, the Mining sector (C) in most dimA-dimA+1 planes and the Financial sector (J) in some planes have coordinates far from the origin compared to the other sectors, despite the fact that their contributions to the dimensions are low for the plane in question. (Much lower than some sectors that are represented closer to the origin.) In those planes, the Mining sector (to go with that example) is badly represented since it it far from the projection plane. The sector should not be represented. 

The sectors in question are sectors that net sell assets during some years, i.e. their investment is negative during these years. The financial sector is the sector with the most negative values, the mining sector is maybe the sector with the most pronounced negative values (Denmark). 

It was tried to set the negative values to 0, but the phenomenon of the big distances although small contributions remained. Thus, the phenomenon is not generated by a conceptual issue of having negative values in a "frequency table". 

Further tests to perform to investigate the origin of the issue :
- remove Denmark from the sample.
- set all negs to NA and perform imputeMDA and then run MFACT


\subsubsubsection{Interpretation of the new dimensions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Dim1 : captures mostly that the Real estate sector is the one investing in residential structures. The contributions from all countries are about the same to this dimension, except for UK and Australia, whose contributions are about half the others. UK and Australia have the most marked trajectory for Other along this axis. Real estate is opposed to Mining (C) ; UK and Australia have a bigger Mining sector. On the assets-side, RStruc is opposed to OMach, OCon and TraEq, which together are the 4 main asset-types. 
\item Dim2 : captures investment by the Mining sector. The countries with the highest contributions are UK, Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands and the USA, which are the 5 countries whose mining sector invests the largest share of VA (see figure \ref{fig:I_I-VA_bar8x_C}). Amongst products, the biggest contributor is Other ; although it is not the product-type the Mining sector spends most on, it is picked up by the analysis because this asset is specific to the mining sector (knowledge obtained through mineral exploration). (Many sectors invest in OCon.) UK and AUS are the biggest contributors to this dimension because they both have the most-spending mining sectors, and who also invest in Other. USA's mining sector is big, but invests in OCon, there is no Other counted.
\item Dim3 : opposes investment in TraEq and OMach, where the former is associated with the transport sector (60t63) and the latter with the Manufacturing sector. TraEq is also associated with the Post and Telecomm sector. The countries where Manufacturing (D) is a large contributor to OMach are Spain, Finland, Italy, Japan and the Netherlands. The countries where the Transport sector is the biggest contributor to TraEq are Denmark and Finland. Spain and Italy are two countries where the Post Telecomm sector contributes a sizeable share to investment in TraEq (these might also be accounting anomalies.) Thus, the countries that contribute most to this dimension are characterized by one or more of the afformentioned aspects. Finland's contribution to OMach by sector D is large and also it's sector Transport contributes a large share to TraEq, which makes it the biggest contributor as a country. Italy and Spain are large contributors because they are both large contributors to OMach and to TraEq, with 2 sectors investing in TraEq.
\item Dim4 : opposes Software and IT to OMach and TraEq. It is the financial sector who's investment pattern is associated woth Software and IT, and Agr, Manufact, Transport are associated with Mach nd TraEq. 
\item Dim5 : opposes TraEq to OCon and CT. Community is associated with OCon, Transport with TraEq and CT is associated with TeleComm (64). The CT trajectory and thus TeleComm is for all countries associated with Community, except for Spain and Italy, which seems to be an accounting issue (figure \ref{fig:I_I-VA_bar12x_CT}).  
\item Dim6 : This dimension captures that UK, USA, JPN, the Netherlands have a Telecomm sector that invests mosts in CT. I.e. a large share of CT investment comes from the Telecomm sector. See figures \ref{fig:I_I-Iprod_bar12x_CT} and \ref{fig:I_I-VA_bar12x_CT}. It opposes CT and OMach to OCon. OCon is associated to Community. CT and OMach are associated with TeleComm and a little bit Manufacturing.
\item Dim7 : this dimension captures the countries who's agricultural sector invested a lot in Other (land conversion), mostly in Australia, also, to a lesser extent in France, Spain, FInland and the Netherlands.   
\item Dim8 : is about the Rental sector (71t74). What is its relation to Financial. Associated with TraEq and IT. Japan, France, Netherlands 
\item Dim9 :
\item Dim10 :
\end{itemize}
The graphs with the time trajectories of the industries of the countries who have a mining sector that invests in Other, plus also the USA, are all dominated by the trajectory of the mining sector that invests in Other. Although the contribution of this sector to the dimensions is low, the trajectory is situated much further from the origin than the trajectories that do have a sizeable contribution to the dimensions. Franck N. does not really understand nor do I. Solution : not plot the mining sector, or do the analysis without the category Other.

The dimensions are dominated by particular, rather unique, events, such as dimension 7, which is not our point of interest. The question we ask might be, disregarding these particular events, what are the similarities between industries ?

\section{Results}
We discuss the structure of investment and its evolution for 11 countries (9 European + Japan 	and USA) for which nominal investment data are available over a period starting in the seventies and running up to 2007. For 4 more European countries data are available starting in the nineties. The 15 countries are listed in table \ref{IVA_trends} which indicates the data availability of I and VA over the period \lies{Todo}. The focus is on the temporal evolution of the structure of investment, by which is both meant evolutions over time of the relative weight of the investing industries as of the relative weight of assets in which is invested; the latter both for the total economy as for individual industries. This analysis of the structure of investment starts in section ... and is preceded by a discussion of evolution of the share of value added allocated to fixed capital formation (section \ref{IVAtrends}).

[Decomposition of "evolution of investment structure" : \\
1. Volume (respect to VA). What share of VA is allocated to GFCF. Correlation income per capita and GFCF/VA ? Do richer countries invest a lower share of VA and invest less as they become richer?\\
1bis. Overall trends of I/VA \\
2. Structure asset types whole economy -> NonICT assets constant in share of VA? constant shares amongst themselves? \\
3. Structure industries whole economy\\
4. Industries $\times$ assets]\\
\subsection{Overall investment trends}\label{IVAtrends}
We first evaluate whether the long term trend of the share of value added (VA) allocated to investment in fixed capital (I) is similar for the countries in our sample. The overall trend is then decomposed in trends per asset type on the one hand and in trends per industry on the other hand. When we say that investment decreased or increased, it is meant relative to VA.

%some countries in our sample invest "more" or "less" than others and whether there is a temporal evolution in their level of investment, by examining the share of national income --- value added (VA) --- allocated to the formation of fixed capital. 
\subsubsection{Relation GFCF/VA to VA/capita ?}
%-> Equal variability over countries in all types of assets ? (relative to % VA.)
For the 11 countries in our sample for which data are available from the '70s on --- which are all OECD countries with an income per capita in 2015 in-between 26000 and 56000 USD (UN) --- the share of value added allocated to the formation of fixed capital for a given country and a given year ranges between 20\% and up to 35\%. \lies{Insert graphs and figures $+$ detail the range - if we exclude Spain and the countries catching up (Slovenia, Czechia), the range narrows towards the end of the period.} At the lower end of this spectrum are the USA and the UK. These 2 countries' behaviour of investing a smaller share of VA than other countries can be decomposed by ordering the different asset types according to what degree these two countries invest less in them than other countries\lies{reformulate} : OCon, Residential, TraEq, OMach, IT, CT, Soft\footnote{Other is excluded because of its difficulty to compare accross countries, and also low share of total investment, except for a few (seperate discussion ?).}. Within the group of countries, the US and the UK thus they differ most from other countries in the share of VA allocated to investment in OCon (..\% less than average) and in Software (..\% more than average).

The share of value added allocated to the formation of fixed capital, I/VA, decreased\footnote{as measured by a linear trend} in all 11 countries in our sample for which data are available from the seventies on up to 2007\footnote{For Czechia, Germany, Slovenia and Sweden, for different reasons, data are only available starting in the mid-nineties, which compromises the comparison of a long-term trend.}, except for in Spain, due to a boom in the construction sector from the mid-nineties on%\footnote{In Spain, there in an increase in investment in Other construction from the mid-nineties on and a sharp rise in investment in residential structures in the 2000s.}. 
Table \ref{IVA_trends} specifies the direction of the linear trends of $I/VA$ per asset -type and per country; table \ref{table:growthRate-TOT-mean} specifies average growth rates of I/VA per asset-level and country, i.e. the means of the yearly growth rates of $\mathrm{I_{cyp}/VA_{cy}}$.

%A linear decreasing trend of the share of VA allocated to investment characterizes the evolution of GFCF in these 11 countries, with as exception Spain, due to its high level of investment in Residential structures and also Other construction (which includes non-residential structures and infrastructure) during the 2000s. 

Thus for 10 countries, total GFCF over the whole economy and all asset-types decreased despite the consistent increase in investment in ICT assets, which reaches at the end of the period $\approx$ 8.5\% of GFCF (Italy, Spain) up to $\approx$ 17\% (Denmark, UK, USA) (view table \ref{Summary_endmeans_shareGFCF_percountry_TOT}). %This also seems to suggest that the introduction of new types of goods did not increase the volume of investment but rather moved investment from one type of capital to another (Is it reasonable to say this? Small shares to ICT depending on the industry. Which industries are the ones investing in ICT?) %For each of the countries in the sample, the share of total GFCF allocated to ICT investment increases from around 3\% to 6\% in the seventies to up to $\approx$ 8.5\% of GFCF (Italy, Spain) and $\approx$ 17\% (Denmark, UK, USA) (view table \ref{Summary_endmeans_shareGFCF_percountry_TOT}). 
ICT equipment is a relatively new type of equipment for the period under consideration, object of constant technological progress and price decreases, which explains its increasing share in total investment\footnote{A similar trend has been observed pre-WWI for Machinery and Equipment\citep{}.}. It follows that the share allocated to the other assets (NonICT) decreases, and more so than total GFCF. The asset-types that are not ICT are Residential structures (RStruc), Other construction (OCon), Travel equipment (TraEq), Other machinery and equipment (OMach) and Other. This last category groups different types of both tangibles such as cultivated assets, fuel elements for nuclear reactors, musical instruments and intangibles, such as knowledge obtained trough mineral exploration and artistic originals. The content of Other is very different from country to country and thus not comparable across countries (and will be discussed separately). In first instance, it is excluded.

Table \ref{IVA_trends} shows not each of these  4 nonICT-asset-types evolved equally over the period considered. Considering the two asset-types that are constructions, OCon decreased significantly in 10 of the 11 countries, with as only exception Spain, whereas RStruc decreased in only 7 of the 11 countries. Indeed, whereas Spain is the only country to see an increase in investment in OCon, from the mid-nineties on, also Australia, the UK and the USA see an increase in the share of VA invested in residential structures. 

Amongst the 2 asset-types that are Machinery and equipment, it is investment in OMach that decreased significantly as share of VA in all countries except for in Denmark. Also investment in Travel equipment decreases, but the trend is less obvious, with 6 countries exhibiting a non-significant trend. 

To describe in further detail these decreasing investment trends, we decompose these trends per industrial sector. It could be that all sectors became equally less capital intensive, or that less capital intensive industries increased in relative size (as measured by proporions of total GFCF or VA). Additionnally, it could be that sectors that became less capital intensive decreased investment in different asset-types in the same proportions as the whole economy or in a differentiated manner. 

We start by decomposing the trends in OMach and OCon. The sector constributing most to investment in OMach is the Manufacturing sector (D), with at the beginning of the period spending from 30\% (DNK) up to more than 50 \% in several countries. This contribution decreased in all countries but 4 : Austria and Finland (almost constant) and increased in Japan. Relative to investment in TraEq and Con however, OMach only decreased in 2 countries : Australia and Italy. Thus, the share of investment by the manufacturing sector going to OMach increased in most countries, whereas the share of VA going to OMach decreased in all countries. This is because of the sharply decreasing size of the manufacturing sector both in total GFCF as in VA in all countries but Austria, Denmark, Japan. 

The biggest constributor to investment in OCon is LtQ which contributes, depending on the country and moment in time, 20\% to 50\% to investment in OCon. The contribution to total GFCF by LtQ decreases in importance in some, increases or stays the same in others. The sector spends a decreasing share in Other construction (except for Spain and Japan) and thus increasing shares both on TraEq and Omach, mostly on OMach.  sThe other sectors that contribute to OCon are : 

%So there is a hierarchy in investment pattern, because the consistent decrease in OMach as a share of VA is due to a sector becoming smaller (D). The sector in question actually spent less over time on OCon and more on machinery.


The Netherlands have high investment in construction in the beginning of the period, but there is a large decrease in OMach, from 19\% to 10\% of GFCF between the beginning and the end of the period, which results in an increasing share of Con within Con+Mach, whereas the share of Con in total GFCF decreases. %For the countries in the sample, roughly half (40 - 50 \%) of investment in Other Machinery comes from the manufacturing sector at the beginning of the period under consideration. For many of the countries in our sample, the sector becomes much less important in size towards the end of the period, and specifically, fo the Netherlands, it halfs in size. 


These differentiated trends amongst asset-types can be explained by, and interpreted as revealing, several mechanisms. A first possible explanation is that depreciation-rates are lower for Construction than for Equipment than in its turn for ICT. Here, one has to keep in mind the different factors summarized by depreciation-rates: they include both physical deterioration through use (typical for Construction), as obsolescence through technological innovation and better substitutes coming to market (typical for IT). The consistent decrease of spending on OCon (Infrastructure$+$non-residential structures) can also be interpreted as that these countries have been under-investing in Constructions. For example, for the USA the generally accepted view is that its Infrastructure is in bad shape, as put forward by the American Society of Civil Engineers by giving it a D+ scorecard (2017). Then again, as already mentioned, the USA invests the least in OCon as a percentage of VA amongst the group of 11 considered. Hence, the USA's apparent under-spending on infrastructure is not necessarily an indicator that the other countries in the sample underspend on infrastructure because their spending in OCon decreases over the period considered. It might also be that highly developed countries already have much Construction-type assets in place and thus are able to shift their spending to other assets such as Machinery and Equipment and ICT. The differentiated evolution in investment in asset-types would thus reflect the evolution of the productive system of developped economies. This view is supported by \citep{mutreja2014equipment} whose finding, that the value of equipment capital between developped and developping countries diverges over time and in construction capital converges over time, suggests that there is some "developmental hierarchy" in asset types: a population first needs housing, and Equipment is not productive without Non-residential structures and Infrastructure. Moreover, \citep{eaton2001trade} finds that "most of the world’s [equipment] capital is produced in a small number of R\&D-intensive countries, while the rest of the world generally imports its equipment". This means that without sufficient infastructure in place, a country cannot import and transport acquired productive equipment to develop its economy.  \lies{(compare investment data in Equipment and Construction 1870-...)} 

Both facts (if they are true) that developping countries spend a bigger share of GFCF on Construction and that developped countries, as they become richer, as measured by income per capita, spend less and less on construction, can be summarized as the higher the income per capita, the lower spending on construction capital. Also, the fact that GFCF has been decreasing over time as a share of VA (in our sample of 11 countries), can be interpreted that as countries become richer, less is spent on durables and more on non-durables\footnote{There is also the problem of monetary capital, income, that is not invested in the economy.}. \li{Test for a negative correlation GFCF/VA and VA/Capita, all countries, all years.

\subsubsection{Does investment in ICT influence investment in the other asset-types ?}

The main investing industrial sectors in ICT capital are, in order of decreasing contributions, Community (LtQ), Rental (71t74), Manufacturing (D), Financial (J) and Sales (GtH), with a rather large variability between countries. The Transport (60t63) and Telecomm (64) sectors are close followers (tables \ref{Summary_means_shareGFCF_percountry_ICT}, \ref{Summary_initmeans_shareGFCF_percountry_ICT}, \ref{Summary_endmeans_shareGFCF_percountry_ICT}). (Together they represent x\% of investment in ICT capital. See figure... (to create for ICT)). The tables in section \ref{Summary_means_shareGFCF_percountry} indicate per country and for each industry what share of the industries' total investment-level is allocated to ICT assets, on average, in the beginning and at the end of the period. 

We now want to assess whether the investment in ICT assets for each of these industries had an impact on the level of its investment in the other assets. I.e., for the total economy, there is a correlation (accidental?) between ICT up and NonICT down. Is this correlation more or less present in these industries that contribute most ot ICT investment ? Also, related question, which are the industries that allocate the largest share of their investment to ICT ? %(This question is distinct to the question which are the ones that contribute most to ICT.) 
The ones that allocate most of their investment to ICT are likely to be most affected (in the sense that their investment level in other assets is most affected by their increasing investment in ICT) and might also be industries that exist because of the new kind of capital.

The industries for which ICT investment is a large share of their capital investment : 
LtQ, except for France, Italy, Japan, Austria (Spain).
71t74, renting, for many countries around 50\% end of period. except for Italy
J: Finance - huge share towards end of period
64, Telecomm : Communication technologies mainly. ICT around 50\%, except for Australia.
60t63 : CT high for Spain and Italy -> accounting issues
GtH : Finland and Denmark high
F : High in some countries towards end of period. (Construction small share of total investment)
D : Manufacturing, high in some countries towards end of the period, mainly in Software. 

So the industries that are both the main investing industries in ICT and allocate a large part of their total investment in FC to ICT are : 
71t74 : this is the only sector that grows in all countries over the period considered (see fig \ref{fig:I_I-VA_bar8x_71t74}), in terms of the share of total investment done by this sector. Investment as a share of total VA also increased in all countries except for in Italy (but that is because of an accounting mistake)(missing is evolution of the industries' VA as a share of total VA).
 
It is the only sector that consistently grows in all countries over the period considered. Total investment as a share of value added increases

LtQ. Total investment by the sector as a share of value added increased in all countries over time, except for 4 countries --- Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Italy (table \ref{gR_I-VA_percountry_LtQ_mean}). The first 3 of these countries are the ones in our group that already invested +5\% of VA at the beginning of the period.
J
D
GtH

The telecomm sector allocates a huge share to CT, but is a small sector in total GFCF (2-3\%).

What is the relation of these 5 sectors to ICT investment ? 
\begin{itemize}
\item LtQ :
\item 71t74 :
\item J :
\item D : Figure \ref{fig:I_I-Iind_bar8x_D} indicates a relatively constant or slightly decreasing share in investment in OMach, decreasing in OCon. When looking at I/VA (\ref{fig:I_I-VA_bar8x_D}), decrease of the importance of the sector in the total economy, Is the decrease in OMach investment proportional to its decrease in importance in the total economy ? Decrease in OCon and OMach porportional ? 
\item GtH :
\end{itemize}

64 : in Denmark, investment in CT is done by another sector.

%The evolution of I/VA decomposed per asset types sheds a light on whether the introduction of new assets contributed to the decrease in investment in other assets.

The sector that clearly becomes bigger is 71t74, which rents out Travel Equipment, Other Machinery and Equipment, OCon, IT and Software to other sectors. What part is for own use and what part is for renting out to other sectors ? 

The Manufacturing sector (D), remains about the same (as a share of total investment, not as a share of VA), in Austria,  Denmark, 
decreases strongly in Spain, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Uk and USA, Australia,
increases somewhat in Japan,

\subsection{Construction}

Concentrating on the investment share in Residential structures (RStruc) and Other construction (OCon) for all industries, figure \ref{fig:I_Share_Constr-TOT} seems to show, at times, an opposite movement in the share of total investment allocated to either one : when investment in RStruc grows, investment in OCon decreases. The effect is most clear for the USA. Figure \ref{fig:I_share_growthrates_Constr-TOT} presents scatter plots of the annual growth rates of the share in RStruc and OCon per country. The lines represent simple linear least squares regressions, and somewhat confirm the opposite short term trend in investment in both construction-type assets. Of the 15 countries in the dataset, a negative trend is significant for 7 countries at the 5\% level, 7 countries present a mean non-significant trend, of which for 6 (3 of them very few data points) the point estimate is negative ; for 1 country Germany, the trend is significantly positive.
%, there are too few data points for 3 countries (nvertheless the point estimate of the trend is negative).

Todo :
\begin{itemize}
\item Decompose OCon into investment from the contributing industries
\item Redo the regressions of growth rate OCon share against RStruc share on their residuals of a linear regression (on time).
%\item Properly decompose in overall growth, periods of simultaneaous growth in both and periods of counter movement.  
\item Why ?

Figure \ref{fig:I_shareTraEq_TraEq} shows the transport equipment-using sectors --- Transport, Agriculture, Manufacturing, Retail, Construction --- started in the nineties renting equipment from the Renting of M\&Eq and Other Business Activities ("Rental") (and in the US also from the Finance industries?). Is there an efficiency gain ? Does investment in Travel Equipment grow less fast then in total FC (question to answer with real data, for the traditional 5 + CT only, without Soft and IT or these to nominal?
