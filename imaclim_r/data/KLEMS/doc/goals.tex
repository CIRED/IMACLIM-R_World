\section{Goals of the study}
\begin{enumerate} 
    \item Format the data so that it can be used
    \item Produce a GFCF matrix in the imaclim format and check whether the assumption of colinearity is valid (hypothesis is that it is not)
    \item Compare to AMECO or other databases
    \item Identify general trends by countries in temporal evolution
    \item Identify group of countries with similar GFCF structure and / or evolution
    \item Provide the GFCF matrices for Imaclim, for France \& the 12 regions and design scenarios for their evolution
    \item Use these matrices to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Evaluate compared to standard assumption
            \item Understand the economic impacts
            \item Understand the emission impacts
        \end{itemize}
    \item Link with growth
\end{enumerate}
