0. 2 files for electricity investment:
* nexus.electricity.idealPark for the ideal park
* nexus.electricity.realInvestment for actual investment
Files dedicated to biomass
* Calibration.elec.biomass.sce

1. On biomass
1.1. Ideal park
* Define a technology
* Definition of LCC : depends on used biomass quantity thus on sum(MSH(biomass))
* Find "the" combination of MSH for biomass that make the system work
1.2. Real park
* Find the production of biomass needed
* Find the prices of biomass
* Update CFuel for biomass and emissions accordingly
1.3. After equilibrium computation
* Check that actual quantity of electricity production is close enough that biomass price is close to the expected one

2. On the electric sector
2.1. Check whether biomass technologies are used ?
2.2. Check consistency of new technology with previous ones
2.3. Calibrate intangible costs
2.4. Check evolution of intangible costs (where is it ?)
